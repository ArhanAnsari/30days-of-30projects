# Challenge Announcement

A new challenge for my tech giaic community.

## 30 Days of 30 Projects**

The idea is to build 30 different projects using TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Next.js, and other latest tech-stack. Each project will will build with components. Every day, I'll introduce a new project with a small use case, providing a detailed, step-by-step written guide. This guide will explain what to do and how to build the project from scratch, all within a day.

### Summary

- **Daily Projects:** One project per day using the latest tech stack for the next 30 days.
- **Guided Learning:** Each project will be accompanied by a simple, step-by-step written article explaining the code and process.
- **Skill Development:** Participants will dedicate time daily to the challenge, creating cool mini products for their skillset and portfolios.

### Project Details

**Each project focuses on a specific functionality and can be built within a day, providing a solid introduction to using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and other technologies in a practical, hands-on way.**
